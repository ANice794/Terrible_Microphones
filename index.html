<h1>Terrible Microphones</h1>

<p>
    Do you ever feel like your microphone quality is just too good? 
    Do you ever miss the days where you would hop online with your friends and occasionally their microphone peaks causing an annoying but funny sound?

    Whether you miss that nostalgic sound of a microphone peaking, or you need a cheap microphone for gaming and chats with friends, we've got the perfect selection of microphones that have terrible quality but still work reasonably well.
